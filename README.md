C is a general-purpose programming language that was developed in the early 1970s. It's known for its efficiency and control over system resources, which makes it a popular choice for system programming (like operating systems and embedded systems).

## Key Features of C Language
1. **Low-Level Access**: C provides low-level access to memory through the use of pointers, which allows for efficient manipulation of hardware and system resources.
2. **Efficiency**: Programs written in C are generally very fast and efficient, making C a preferred choice for performance-critical applications.
3. **Portability**: C code is highly portable. Programs written in C can be compiled and run on a variety of computer architectures with little or no modification.
4. **Modularity**: C supports modular programming, enabling large programs to be broken down into manageable pieces.
5. **Rich Library**: C has a rich set of built-in functions and libraries, which facilitates the development of a wide range of applications.

## Fundamental Concepts
1. **Variables and Data Types**: Variables in C are used to store data. Common data types include int, float, char, and double.
2. **Operators**: C includes a variety of operators for arithmetic, logical, bitwise, and relational operations.
3. **Control Structures**: Includes if, else, while, for, and switch statements for flow control.
4. **Functions**: Functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help in organizing code and reusability.
5. **Pointers**: Variables that store memory addresses. Pointers are powerful tools for dynamic memory management and efficient array handling.
6. **Arrays and Strings**: Arrays are collections of elements of the same type. Strings are arrays of characters.
7. **Structures**: Custom data types that group variables of different types.

# Memory Management
C provides manual memory management through the use of *malloc*, *calloc*, *realloc* , and *free* functions. This allows developers to allocate and deallocate memory dynamically during runtime.

# File I/O
C supports file input and output operations, allowing programs to read from and write to files. This is accomplished through standard library functions such as *fopen*, *fclose*, *fread*, *fwrite*, *fprintf*, and *fscanf*.
